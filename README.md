# Obsidian-HowTo

This is a pretty thorough and condensed tutorial on how to start using Obsidian, that I originally intended to prepare only for myself, in case I needed to refresh my memory. It should take about 15-20 minutes to complete.
## How to download and use this tutorial

- click open vault in obsidian and choose the cloned repo folder
- start tutorial from reading "Tutorial start" note

# Who is Obsidian for?
To be honest, I have no idea, but **I do have an idea why it worked for me specifically** (and why it might work for you). I will only try to tell you my story with Obsidian, and I won't try convince you why you should be using it. 
## Why I started using Obsidian?

I wrote this section as a numbered list of my personal problems, and how I try to solve them by using Obsidian:
1. I have a really bad memory, sometimes it takes a lot of time and brain power for me to just remember basic information. I waste a lot of time just remembering stuff. I forget a lot of things.
	- Obsidian allows me to write stuff down, so I do not have to remember them. However this is the functionality that even Windows Notepad app provides. However, most note taking applications store notes as files in a classic, hierarchical data structure, like files in Files Explorer. Obsidian changes this paradigm, by adding links to the classical hierarchical data structure. Essentially it is a "second brain": think of Obsidian notes as neurons, and links as connection between these neurons. Think of "graph view" Obsidian functionality as a representation of this "second brain" (commonly known as mind map, but better, because "the neurons" are complete notes, and not just single words). 
	- By storing my main obsidian vault on github as a repository, my notes are multiplatform, synched on all of my devices (by doing a lot of git pulls, commits and pushes, and with the help of Working Copy app on iOS and iPadOS) and always available, both locally and in the cloud.
		- Git also gives me all the benefits of a VCS
		- There is a paid Obsidian Sync version of Obsidian, which offers you built-in Obsidian cloud sync, but I prefer Github, because git is a VCS 
2. I overanalyze stuff and I feel like all those unresolved thoughts clog up my brain, and because of it I have troubles with clear, logical, structured thinking . 
	- Obsidian allows me to write down my thoughts in a clear structure, so I never get lost in the sauce. I can also track down my thought process by using note backlinks, and make any connections between notes by using links between notes.
3. I'm never satisfied with my ideas, I am always paranoid that if I stop thinking about something I will not uncover some hidden "truth", that my thoughts are supposed to lead me to eventually.
	- Obsidian allows me to write down every idea I ever thought about, so I never forget about it. By using built-in searching functionality and tags, I can even check if I have already thought about something in the past, so I don't repeat my thoughts unintentionally, which I hate more then anything else (its suuuuch a waste of time and makes life so boring in the long run). There is nothing more satisfying (and sort of sad), then searching for some idea which seems like completely new and fresh, and finding out that I've already thought about it, but I forgot about it 
		- Search functionality is also very helpful when doing any type of research, it allows you to not re-research things you researched in the past, but I guess that is the whole point of note-taking and not something specific offered by Obsidian. However I will stress again, that in my opinion Obsidian offers a better structure of notes then other note-taking apps I've tried (I haven't tried any other besides stuff like Windows Notepad or Apple Notes, so I am probably just discovering the idea of a mind map and act like I discovered something incredible that I need to share with everyone lol).   
## Why note-taking is nice in general? 
1. When I take notes, I free the "hard-drive" type of data from my brain. I think that brain has no designates spot for hard-drive and RAM, like PC, so I try to only focus on RAM (working memory, the things I am actively thinking about at this specific moment)
	- I think it also kind of explains why I feel "lighter" after using obsidian for some time, and I have less headaches. Maybe it is because I don't need to overuse my brain just to remember stuff. I can just put them in Obsidian and take a look whenever I want to refresh my memory, or revise some already well thought out idea.
2. When I write stuff down, I am actually explaining it to myself, which means that I can understand and develop my ideas better (whatever better means depending on the context, whether I am creating a computer application, doing groceries, or thinking about anime \[redacted\])
3. I don't feel like I am wasting time. I can see what I did everyday by creating daily notes (basic Calendar Obsidian plugin allows me to do it efficiently)\
## What unexpected functionalities/use-cases surprised me the most when I started using Obsidian?

- I think it is the fact that I can "measure" how creative I am, by looking how strongly coupled (by Obsidian links) are my thoughts (Obsidian notes). Others notetaking tools, e.g. Apple Notes, or Windows Notepad, don't offer this graph view functionality, which is why Obsidian is so cool in my opinion.
- Obsidian completely changed how I approach writing any type of text. Instead of first creating sections like Introduction, Summary, Abstract etc. I just compose text from smaller notes, until it becomes a complete structure naturally. Basically, I used to write text using top-down approach, but now I prefer down-top approach, in which I collect all the thoughts about the topic of text, before I impose any kind of structure on it.  

## How I am currently using Obsidian (what is my workflow)?
- I store everything in single private vault called "Second Brain". I think it is better than having multiple vaults, because it restricts your ability to make arbitrary links between notes.
- If I am not doing something specific, and I am just writing down my thoughts, I put them all inside the daily note (e.g. note called "2024-08-28"). Then in the evening I try to find time to actually look through these random thoughts, and fit them into my Obsidian structure. 

# In case you decide to give Obsidian a chance 
Even though I've just glazed Obsidian so much, more then anything else, it is just a note-taking tool like any other. It was a solution to specific problems I had, that concerned note-taking, that I wasn't able to solve using basic note-taking apps (not to mention paper, fuck paper frfr). If you are not sure what you might be using Obsidian for, then there is a chance that you don't need to use it. The problems I listed in the section above are very personal, and I don't want to feel like I am projecting my problems onto you, the reader. Different things work for different people. Nevertheless, even if you have might have second thoughts after reading this section, if I were you, I would give Obsidian a shot anyway. It might work or it might not, but you will never know until you try it, and it is pretty easy to learn if you only focus on writing notes and making links between them, and forget about additional functionalities offered by community plugins.
