1. When you note stuff, you free the "hard-drive" type of data of your brain. Remember that brain has no designates spot for hard-drive and RAM, like PC, so you should only focus on RAM (working memory)
	- I think it actually explains why I feel "lighter" after using obsidian all the time. I just don't need to overuse my brain just to remember stuff. I can just put them here and take a look whenever I feel like refreshing my memory, or considering some already well thought out idea
2. When you write stuff down, you actually explain it better, which means you understand and develop it better
3. You don't feel like you are wasting time. You can see what you did everyday, especially thanks to the calendar plugin ([[Most important community plugins]])
4. You can "measure" how creative you are, by looking how strongly coupled (by references) are your thoughts (notes)
	- Others notetaking tools, e.g. Apple Notes, or Windows Notepad, don't offer this graph view functionality, which is why Obsidian is so cool
