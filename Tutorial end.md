But how did I even end up here???? Fortunately, I have 2 cool options:
1. If I just want to go to parent notes in order to trace back my whole thinking process step by step, I can click on "More Options/Backlinks in document" (TR corner)
2. If I want to see my whole "brain" with all its neurons (notes) and synapses (links), I can click on "Open graph view" (L)

Now feel free to checkout other notes that will help you on your Obsidian journey:

	- Before you start downloading community plugins, I would recommend to get accustomed to the **most basic, easiest to use and most powerful tools offered by Obsidian, which are basic links and backlinks**. Remember that all other plugins are just some nice aesthetic, but the links and backlinks between arbitrary notes are what makes Obsidian so useful, as it better represents how human store information in their brains, by making a lot of connections between seemingly disconnected ideas. Also, downloading community plugins at the beginning of your Obsidian journey will only confuse you, as they vary greatly in the learning curve and usefulness, there are thousands of them and can even make you hate Obsidian because eventually it will become too hard and complex to use efficiently.
