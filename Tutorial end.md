But how did I even end up here???? Fortunately, I have 2 cool options:
1. If I just want to go to parent notes in order to trace back my whole thinking process step by step, I can click on "More Options/Backlinks in document" (TR corner)
2. If I want to see my whole "brain" with all its neurons (notes) and synapses (links), I can click on "Open graph view" (L)
